• Make privacy stick with five new official sticker packs in the Signal Artist Series: "Chug the Mouse" by Amanda Cotan, "Cozy Season" by Miguel Ángel Camprubí, "Croco's Feelings" by Tiffany Beucher, "My Daily Life 2" by Plastic Thing, and "Rocky Talk" by Lexi Vay.
• This update includes the next wave of design improvements for iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. Take an optimistic look at the new message bubbles floating in front of your favorite chat wallpaper in a Liquid Glass cup that's more than half-full.
